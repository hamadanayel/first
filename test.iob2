The	B-Treatment
Keflex	I-Treatment
was	O
stopped	O
when	O
she	O
developed	O
the	B-Problem
diarrhea	I-Problem
.	O
	
When	O
she	O
arrived	O
the	O
plan	O
was	O
to	O

treat	O

and	O
possible	O
cellulitis	B-Problem
with	O
IV	B-Treatment
antibiotics	I-Treatment
.	O
	
So	O
she	O
was	O
put	O
on	O
dicloxicillin	B-Treatment
and	O
we	O
did	O
local	B-Treatment
wound	I-Treatment
care	I-Treatment
with	O
an	B-Treatment
agent	I-Treatment
called	O
Santyl	B-Treatment
,	O
which	O
is	O
a	B-Treatment
collagenace	I-Treatment
ondebrided	I-Treatment
which	O
worked	O
very	O
well	O
for	O
her	O
.	O
	
Also	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
admission	O
we	O
were	O
also	O
considering	O
palliative	B-Treatment
Taxol	I-Treatment
chemotherapy	I-Treatment
,	O
which	O
the	O
patient	O
declined	O
.	O
	
She	O
refused	O
the	B-Treatment
Taxol	I-Treatment
therapy	I-Treatment
so	O
that	O
was	O
not	O
done	O
.	O
	
Another	O
major	O
issue	O
with	O
this	O
patient	O
was	O
pain	B-Treatment
control	I-Treatment
.	O
	
She	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
a	O
whole	O

of	O
pain	B-Problem
from	O
her	B-Problem
left	I-Problem
arm	I-Problem
lesion	I-Problem
.	O
	
So	O
pain	B-Treatment
control	I-Treatment
was	O
a	O
big	O
issue	O
so	O
she	O
was	O
on	O
MS	B-Treatment
Contin	I-Treatment
and	O
MSIR	B-Treatment
at	O
home	O
she	O
thought	O
that	O
clouded	O
her	O
thinking	O
,	O
so	O
we	O
tried	O
different	O
things	O
for	O
pain	B-Treatment
management	I-Treatment
.	O
	
One	O
of	O
them	O
was	O
to	O
do	O
a	B-Treatment
subarachnoid	I-Treatment
neurologic	I-Treatment
block	I-Treatment
at	I-Treatment
C6-C7	I-Treatment

After	O
that	O
the	O
patient	O
had	O
minimal	O
relief	O
of	O
pain	B-Problem
.	O
	
However	O
,	O
she	O
declined	O
further	B-Treatment
blocks	I-Treatment
,	O
which	O
were	O
offered	O
to	O
her	O
.	O
	
So	O
accepted	O
to	O
be	O
on	O
dilaudid	B-Treatment
p.o.	I-Treatment
which	O
was	O
started	O
at	O
a	O
dosage	O

2-4	O
meg	O
but	O
since	O
then	O
we	O
have	O
tapered	O
it	O
up	O

She	O
is	O
now	O
getting	O
dilaudid	B-Treatment
8	O

and	O
in	O

she	O
has	O
been	O
on	O

She	O
is	O
now	O
getting	O
75	O

the	B-Treatment
fentanyl	I-Treatment

which	O
is	O
changed	O
every	O
72	O
hours	O
.	O
	
We	O
can	O
go	O
up	O
by	O
25	O
mg	O
on	O
the	B-Treatment
fentanyl	I-Treatment
patch	I-Treatment
as	O
needed	O
to	O
control	O
her	B-Problem
pain	I-Problem
and	O
we	O
can	O
always	O
go	O
up	O
on	O
the	B-Treatment
dilaudid	I-Treatment
because	O
she	O
is	O
still	O
in	O
considerable	O
amount	O
of	O
pain	B-Problem
.	O
	
Other	O
things	O
that	O
happened	O
during	O
this	O
admission	O
-	O
we	O
obtained	O
ahead	B-Test
CT	I-Test
for	O
her	O
on	O
the	O
8th	O
of	O
January	O
because	O
of	O
her	B-Problem
clouded	I-Problem
thinking	I-Problem
and	O
altered	B-Problem
mental	I-Problem
status	I-Problem
,	O
which	O
was	O
probably	O
due	O
to	O
the	B-Treatment
morphine	I-Treatment
that	O
she	O
was	O
taking	O
.	O
	
We	O
went	O
ahead	O
and	O
got	O
a	B-Test
head	I-Test
CT	I-Test

it	O
showed	O
no	O

In	O
addition	O
her	B-Test
liver	I-Test
transaminases	I-Test
were	O
elevated	B-Problem
,	O
we	O
thought	O
about	O
doing	O
further	B-Test
work-up	I-Test
,	O
but	O
that	O
was	O
deferred	O
because	O
the	O
patient	O
wanted	O

wait	O
on	O
that	O

That	O
has	O
been	O
stable	O

The	O
patient	O
on	O
January	O
13	O
became	O
hyponatremic	B-Problem
.	O
	
Her	B-Test
sodium	I-Test
went	O
down	O
to	O
121	O
and	O
before	O
that	O
on	O
admission	O
she	O
was	O
133	O

A	O
renal	O
consult	O
was	O
obtained	O
and	O
their	B-Test

that	O
this	O

probably	O
a	O
mixture	O
of	O
hypovolemia	B-Problem
as	O
well	O
as	O
SIADH	B-Problem
.	O
	
We	O
proceeded	O
to	O
do	O
for	O
her	B-Problem
hyponatremia	I-Problem
-	O
we	O
gave	O
her	O
some	B-Treatment
fluid	I-Treatment
and	O
her	B-Test
urine	I-Test
sodium	I-Test
became	O
higher	O
than	O
her	B-Test
serum	I-Test
sodium	I-Test
;	O
we	O
stopped	O
it	O
.	O
	
We	O
had	O
given	O
her	O
some	B-Treatment
normal	I-Treatment
saline	I-Treatment
and	O
then	O
we	O
proceeded	O
to	O
just	O
do	O
fluid	B-Treatment
restriction	I-Treatment
.	O
	
In	O
addition	O
we	O
gave	O
her	O
a	B-Treatment
sodium	I-Treatment
chloride	I-Treatment
one	O
gram	O
per	O
day	O
and	O
that	O
also	O
helped	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
now	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
discharge	O
,	O
the	B-Test
patient	I-Test
&apos;s	I-Test
sodium	I-Test
is	O
between	O
126	O
and	O
129	O
;	O
prior	O
to	O
that	O
it	O
had	O
gone	O
down	O
to	O
as	O
low	O
116.	O
	
So	O
that	O
has	O
really	O
improved	O
.	O
	
We	O
suggest	O
continuing	O
increased	B-Treatment
salt	I-Treatment
intake	I-Treatment
in	O
her	O
diet	O
and	O
also	O
continuing	O
with	O
the	B-Treatment
fluid	I-Treatment
restriction	I-Treatment
of	I-Treatment
free	I-Treatment
water	I-Treatment
intake	I-Treatment
to	O
one	O
liter	O
per	O
day	O
.	O
	
On	O
the	O
14th	O
of	O
January	O
,	O
the	O
patient	O
developed	O
increased	B-Problem
shortness	I-Problem
of	I-Problem
breath	I-Problem
and	O
chest	B-Test
x-ray	I-Test
was	O
taken	O
showed	O
a	B-Problem
wedge	I-Problem
shaped	I-Problem
infiltrate	I-Problem
in	I-Problem
the	I-Problem
right	I-Problem
upper	I-Problem
lobe	I-Problem
which	O
was	O
consistent	O
with	O
Hampton	B-Problem
&apos;s	I-Problem
hump	I-Problem
.	O
	
Also	O
a	B-Test
VQ	I-Test
scan	I-Test
obtained	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
showed	O
high	O
probability	O
for	O
PE	B-Problem
.	O
	
So	O
we	O
proceeded	O
to	O
put	O
her	O
on	O
heparin	B-Treatment
for	O
anticoagulation	B-Treatment
and	O
then	O
when	O
she	O
was	O
therapeutic	O
on	O
heparin	B-Treatment
,	O
we	O
went	O
ahead	O
and	O
started	O
her	O
on	O
coumadin	B-Treatment
and	O
she	O
is	O
currently	O
on	O
coumadin	B-Treatment
at	O
2.5	O
mg	O
q.h.s.	O
	
Her	B-Test
INR	I-Test
is	O
2.3	O
.	O
	
We	O
want	O
her	B-Test
INR	I-Test
to	O
remain	O
between	O
2	O
and	O
3	O
.	O
	
So	O
if	O
it	O
goes	O
much	O
lower	O
than	O
2	O
,	O
then	O
we	O
would	O
consider	O
increasing	O
it	O
to	O
perhaps	O
coumadin	B-Treatment
2.5	O
and	O
5	O
alternating	O
every	O
other	O
night	O
.	O
	
However	O
,	O
we	O
would	O
leave	O
it	O
at	O
2.5	O
for	O
now	O
.	O
	
Other	O
major	O
issues	O
-	O
As	O
a	O
result	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
things	O
happened	O
and	O
with	O
her	B-Problem
hyponatremia	I-Problem
and	O
also	O
the	B-Problem
other	I-Problem
problems	I-Problem
,	O
her	B-Test
blood	I-Test
pressure	I-Test
was	O
elevated	B-Problem
also	O
.	O
	
We	O
put	O
her	O
on	O
nifedipine	B-Treatment
IR	I-Treatment
,	O
SL	O
and	O
that	O
was	O
not	O
enough	O
to	O
control	O
her	B-Test
blood	I-Test
pressure	I-Test
which	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
200s	O
in	O
the	B-Test
systolic	I-Test
,	O
so	O
we	O
had	O
started	O
her	O
on	O
atenolol	B-Treatment
.	O
	
So	O
on	O
discharge	O
she	O
is	O
on	O
atenolol	B-Treatment
100	O
.	O
	
If	O
needed	O
to	O
you	O
can	O
give	O
her	O
some	B-Treatment
nifedipine	I-Treatment
SL	I-Treatment
to	O
decrease	O
her	B-Test
blood	I-Test
pressure	I-Test
.	O
	
The	O
patient	O
also	O
has	O
significant	B-Problem
edema	I-Problem
in	I-Problem
both	I-Problem

now	O
and	O
also	O
some	B-Problem
mild	I-Problem
edema	I-Problem
in	I-Problem
the	I-Problem
lower	I-Problem
extremities	I-Problem
,	O
so	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
fluid	B-Treatment
restriction	I-Treatment
should	O
help	O
with	O
that	O
